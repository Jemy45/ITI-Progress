1. ps aux
---------------------------------------------------------
Description: 
Displays a detailed snapshot of all running processes on the system, 
regardless of the user or terminal association.

Breakdown:
  a : Show processes for all users.
  u : Display the process's user/owner (provides detailed info like CPU/MEM).
  x : Show processes not attached to a terminal (e.g., background daemons).

Common Options:
  --sort=-%cpu : Sort results by CPU usage.
  --sort=-%mem : Sort results by Memory usage.

Examples:

  # Show all processes being run by the "root" user
  ps aux | grep root


2. less
---------------------------------------------------------
Description:
A command-line utility that displays the contents of a file (or command output) 
one page at a time. It allows backward and forward scrolling.

Common Options:
  -N : Display line numbers.
  -S : Chop long lines (don't wrap text to the next line).
  +F : Follow mode (updates as the file grows, similar to 'tail -f').

Example:
  # Open a large log file with line numbers enabled
  less -N /var/log/syslog


3. pgrep
---------------------------------------------------------
Description:
Stands for "process grep". It searches for processes specifically by name 
and outputs their Process IDs (PIDs).

Common Options:
  -l      : List the process name alongside the PID.
  -a      : List the full command line used to start the process.
  -u <user>: Only find processes owned by a specific user.
  -c      : Count the number of matching processes.

Example:
  # Find the PIDs and full command lines of all 'ssh' processes
  pgrep -a ssh
